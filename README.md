# As-Is Process
The onboarding process begins in the HR department, when HR receives the signed contract of the new employee. After creating a new employee profile in Enboarder, an automatic e-mail is sent to the supervisor, requesting them to complete the PDF form ‚ÄúRequest New Employee‚Äù. HR further creates an Active Directory User for the new employee.

After HR receives the completed form from the supervisor by e-mail, they add the new entry in Confluence and open a ticket in the internal ticketing system ‚ÄúServiceNow‚Äù with the PDF attached to initiate the process of setting up the new employee‚Äôs equipment by the IT department.

Communication between the HR and IT department is centres around ServiceNow and the Confluence page to provide information on the ticket status of the new employees entries. The Confluence page is maintained by IT department as a comprehensive overview for HR, as the status of the ticket can only be queried on a user-specific basis in ServiceNow.

To ensure hardware provision to the new employee on time, the ticket must be created at least two weeks prior to the employee‚Äôs start date. When the IT department receives the ticket, it checks it for completeness and accepts the new ticket. If the ticket does not meet the time criteria, the availability of the hardware on the start date cannot be guaranteed and a new date must be set for the hardware handover.

The PDF ‚ÄúRequest New Employee‚Äù is then saved in the network drive and the Confluence page is updated. Furthermore, the IT department opens a ticket at the external provider‚Äôs ticketing system, requesting the setup of the hardware of the new employee. The external ticketing system is the primary communication channel with the external provider. The requested setup includes configuring the notebook, ordering a proxy, granting user access and creating the user in the MDM system. These tasks at the IT department generally require two working days.

There is an SLA with the external provider in place. The ticket must be processed and finalised within six working days, including handover of the hardware back to the IT department.
Upon receiving the notebook, the IT department verifies the completeness and, if necessary, finalises the setup. The notebook is then personalised and access to the required file shares configured. Further the business mobile is prepared. One to two working days before the employees start date, the workstation is completely setup to ensure everything is ready on the first day. The last step is to update the Confluence page.

The supervisor is informed by HR about the readiness of the hardware by e-mail.

On the first workday, the new employee receives their hardware from the IT department and takes part in an introductory IT training session.

HR also notifies the SAP department about the new employee for user creation. The SAP then carries out a user comparison in the system and creates the new user account. If no additional rights are required, the account is handed over to the new employee.

If additional rights are required, the supervisor opens a ticket in ServiceNow to request the necessary roles. An authorization request is created at SAP department and the signature of the key user is obtained. The supervisor signs the request, and the account is updated accordingly.

## Challenges

This document outlines the main operational and organizational challenges identified in the employee onboarding process.

### High Process Complexity & Fragmentation
The onboarding process involves multiple systems (Enboarder, ServiceNow, Confluence, external provider systems, Active Directory, MDM, SAP) and stakeholders (HR, IT, supervisors, SAP department, external providers).  
**Risk:** Process inefficiencies, handover delays, and increased potential for coordination errors.

### Manual and Email-Dependent Communication
Critical process steps (form submission, notifications, status updates) are handled manually via email.  
**Risk:** Low process transparency, missed updates, and lack of traceability.

### Lack of Workflow Automation
Several activities‚Äîsuch as PDF handling, ticket creation, Confluence updates, and internal validations‚Äîare not automated.  
**Risk:** Increased administrative workload, error-proneness, and inconsistent data entry.

### Time Sensitivity vs. Lack of Enforcement
Tickets must be created at least two weeks prior to the start date, but there are no systemic controls or escalation mechanisms in place.  
**Risk:** Missed hardware readiness deadlines and disruption of onboarding timelines.

### Redundant Documentation & Storage
Employee data is documented in multiple locations (PDF, network drive, Confluence, ticketing systems), often manually.  
**Risk:** Data inconsistencies, version conflicts, and duplicated administrative effort.

### Limited Transparency & Status Tracking
ServiceNow does not provide a holistic view of onboarding tickets. The Confluence page, updated manually by IT, is the only central overview for HR.  
**Risk:** Delays in status tracking, high dependency on IT, and inefficient follow-ups.

### Reactive Issue Handling
Late ticket submissions lead to rescheduling of hardware handovers instead of proactive resolution or automated fallback scenarios.  
**Risk:** Negative onboarding experience for new employees, low first-day productivity.
